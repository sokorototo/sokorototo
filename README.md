Hi! I am Newton Toto, a dude based in [Nairobi](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=nairobi&t=hx&va=g&ia=web&iaxm=about). I like to code and making games (average headache enjoyer 🤌🏿). I am bad at art, so that's that. I like cats, like **really** much. I pick up new stuff too often. Likes memes, the Internet, [airsoft](https://youtu.be/j8PxqgliIno) and skateboards. Really wants to get into peer to peer tech. Currently studying Mathematics and Comp Science.
